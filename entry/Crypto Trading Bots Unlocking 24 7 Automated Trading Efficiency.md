## Core Functions of Crypto Trading Bots  

### 1. Data Collection and Analysis  
Bots aggregate and analyze vast datasets from exchanges, including price trends, trading volumes, and order book activity. For example, AI-powered systems process over 130 indicators (e.g., RSI, Bollinger Bands) to identify patterns and predict market movements.  

### 2. Trade Execution  
Once conditions are met, bots place orders within milliseconds. This speed is critical for strategies like **arbitrage**, where price discrepancies across exchanges are exploited. For instance, a sniper bot can bid on digital auctions instantly, capitalizing on fleeting opportunities.  

### 3. Post-Execution Analysis  
After trades, bots review performance against benchmarks. Backtesting ensures strategies align with historical data, while real-time monitoring adjusts parameters for optimal risk management.

## How Crypto Trading Bots Operate  

### Setting Trading Parameters  
Users define rules like stop-loss limits, entry/exit points, and trade frequency. Custom bots allow tailored configurations, such as selecting arbitrage or scalping strategies.  

### Integration with Exchanges  
Bots connect to exchanges via APIs (e.g., KuCoin, Binance), which grant permissions for trade execution. Security measures like IP restrictions and API key encryption are crucial to mitigate risks.
