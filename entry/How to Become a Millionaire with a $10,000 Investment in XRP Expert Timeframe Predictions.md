## Market Capitalization Realities  

To contextualize XRP's growth potential, consider its current market cap (~$120 billion at $2.10). Reaching $210 would require a **100x increase**, dwarfing the total crypto market cap today.

|-------------|---------------|--------------|--------|-------|  
| Bitcoin     | $0.01         | $60,000      | 6,000,000% | 13    |  
| XRP (Bull Case) | $2.10         | $210         | 9,900%     | 5â€“15  |
