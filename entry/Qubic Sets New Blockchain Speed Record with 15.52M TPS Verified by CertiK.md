# Qubic Sets New Blockchain Speed Record with 15.52M TPS Verified by CertiK  

_Live mainnet test establishes unprecedented benchmark for decentralized network performance._  

Ile Du Port, Mahe, Seychelles, April 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) â€” Qubic has achieved the fastest blockchain transaction speed ever recorded, reaching **15.52 million transactions per second (TPS)** on its live Layer 1 mainnet. This groundbreaking milestone was independently verified and published by **CertiK**, a globally recognized blockchain security and auditing firm.  

Unlike previous high-speed tests conducted in controlled environments, Qubicâ€™s achievement represents **real-world performance on a live mainnet**, eliminating reliance on rollups, gas fees, or Layer 2 scaling solutions.  

## Verified Performance on Mainnet  

Qubicâ€™s engineering team executed a live stress test using its proprietary **tick-based architecture**, which synchronizes consensus, execution, and finality in a single cycle. While the test ran for an extended duration, the **certified performance result** â€” **15.52 million TPS and 1.518 billion transfers** â€” was derived from the **10 peak ticks** audited by CertiK.  

### Key Metrics (Certified by CertiK):  
- **Peak TPS:** 15,527,637  
- **Total Transfers:** 1.518 billion  
- **Finality:** Instantaneous, zero delay  

This performance dwarfs existing blockchain networks:  
- **TON:** 104,715 TPS (simulated testnet burst)  
- **Solana:** ~65,000 TPS (ideal conditions)  
- **Sui, Aptos, Arbitrum:** All under 1M TPS  
- **Qubic:** **15.52M TPS â€” on mainnet**  

### Why Mainnet Verification Matters  

A frequently asked question among blockchain developers and investors is: **Why does mainnet verification matter?**  

**Answer:** Most blockchain speed claims rely on testnet environments or theoretical models. Qubicâ€™s achievement demonstrates practical scalability for real-world applications, proving that decentralized networks can rival â€” and exceed â€” centralized systems like Visa (24,000 TPS) or NASDAQ (10M TPS).  

## Designed for Real-World Compute Demands  

Qubicâ€™s innovation extends beyond speed. Its architecture enables **atomic consensus, execution, and finality** in a single cycle, unlocking capabilities previously constrained by blockchain limitations.  

### Key Use Cases Enabled by Qubicâ€™s Architecture:  
1. **AI Compute:** Distributed inference, pipeline orchestration, and decentralized training models.  
2. **DePIN Networks:** Sensor mesh coordination and geospatial routing for IoT devices.

### Addressing Scalability Challenges  

**FAQ: How does Qubicâ€™s tick-based architecture improve scalability?**  

Traditional blockchains batch transactions into blocks, introducing latency. Qubicâ€™s tick-based system processes transactions in synchronized intervals (ticks), eliminating bottlenecks while maintaining security. Each tick achieves finality within milliseconds, enabling seamless scaling for high-throughput applications.  

## CertiK Audit and Transparency  

The test results are fully transparent and accessible through multiple channels:  
- **Qubic Explorer:** On-chain tick data and transaction logs.  
- **Performance Visualizer:** Graphical breakdown of TPS metrics.  
- **Full CertiK Report:** Technical audit findings and methodology.  

This level of transparency builds trust in Qubicâ€™s claims, ensuring stakeholders can independently validate performance benchmarks.  

### Security at High Speed  

**FAQ: Does high TPS compromise blockchain security?**  

CertiKâ€™s audit confirmed that Qubic maintains robust security despite its speed. The tick-based model reduces attack surfaces by eliminating mempools and batch processing vulnerabilities. Additionally, instant finality prevents double-spending risks, ensuring transaction integrity.  

## Industry Implications  

Qubicâ€™s achievement marks a turning point for blockchain adoption across sectors requiring ultra-low latency and massive scalability.  

### Potential Applications:  
| Industry | Use Case | Qubicâ€™s Advantage |  
|---------|----------|------------------|  
| **AI** | Decentralized machine learning training | Real-time data processing at scale |  
| **Logistics** | Global supply chain tracking | Instant transaction finality for IoT devices |  
| **Finance** | High-frequency DeFi trading | Zero-delay settlement for complex derivatives |

### Overcoming Previous Limitations  

**FAQ: How does Qubic differ from other high-speed blockchains?**  

Most high-performance chains rely on Layer 2 solutions or sharding, which fragment data and introduce complexity. Qubicâ€™s Layer 1 mainnet achieves native scalability without compromising decentralization, offering a unified platform for developers and enterprises.  

## Technical Deep Dive: Tick-Based Consensus  

Qubicâ€™s tick-based consensus operates in three synchronized phases:  
1. **Transaction Collection:** Nodes gather transactions until the next tick begins.  
2. **Atomic Processing:** All transactions are executed and finalized within a 100-millisecond tick window.  
3. **State Finality:** Updated blockchain states are confirmed before the next tick cycle.  

This model eliminates confirmation delays, enabling applications to treat transactions as immediately settled.  

### Energy Efficiency and Sustainability  

**FAQ: Is Qubicâ€™s speed environmentally sustainable?**  

Qubicâ€™s **uPoW (micro-Proof-of-Work)** mechanism requires minimal computational resources compared to traditional PoW systems. By optimizing hardware utilization and eliminating redundant validation processes, the network achieves high throughput with a low carbon footprint.  

## Future Outlook  

Qubicâ€™s roadmap includes:  
- **AGI Integration:** Decentralized infrastructure for artificial general intelligence development.  
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Seamless asset and data transfers with other blockchains.  
- **Enterprise Partnerships:** Collaborations with Fortune 500 companies to deploy mission-critical applications.
