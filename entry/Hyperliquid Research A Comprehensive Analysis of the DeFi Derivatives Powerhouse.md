### Key Highlights  
Hyperliquid has emerged as a dominant player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives space, achieving **$12.8M USD in weekly revenue**â€”surpassing even Ethereum. With **$63M USD in accumulated revenue in 2024**, it stands out as one of the most profitable PERP DEX projects.  

**Why Hyperliquid Stands Out:**  
- **Fair Tokenomics:** 70.2% of $HYPER is community-allocated, with no VC dump pressure.  
- **Concentrated Liquidity:** Retains 100% of trading fees, driving native demand.  
- **First-Mover Advantage:** Competes directly with dYdX and GMX while offering a superior user experience.
