## Security Measures for Digital Asset Protection  

### 1:1 Reserve Backing  
Reputable exchanges maintain a 1:1 reserve ratio, ensuring customer deposits are fully backed by equivalent assets. This practice eliminates fractional reserve risks and enhances platform transparency.  

### Cold Storage & Regulatory Compliance  
Over 95% of digital assets are stored in offline cold wallets within geographically distributed vaults, protected by military-grade encryption. Platforms regulated by authorities like Singapore's MAS undergo rigorous audits to guarantee operational integrity.  

### Asset Segregation & Prohibited Activities  
Client funds remain strictly segregated from corporate accounts. Exchanges refrain from engaging in lending, borrowing, or rehypothecation practices, ensuring assets are used solely for trading purposes.
