# Crypto Fees and Limits  

## Understanding Crypto Transaction Costs  

When managing cryptocurrency transactions, understanding fees and limits is crucial for optimizing your experience. At COCA Wallet, we prioritize transparency and user control, ensuring you can navigate crypto transactions seamlessly. Below, we break down the key aspects of our fee structure and transaction policies.  

### No Additional Fees Beyond Network Charges  

COCA Wallet eliminates hidden costs by charging **no additional fees** for its services. Users only pay the standard **network fees** required to process transactions on the blockchain. These fees are determined by the specific cryptocurrency's network (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and fluctuate based on factors like network congestion and transaction size.  

For example, during periods of high demand, Bitcoin transaction fees may rise temporarily. However, with COCA Wallet, you‚Äôll never face extra charges for using our platform‚Äîensuring predictable costs and maximizing the value of your crypto transfers.

### Flexible Miner Fee Adjustments  

Transaction speed on blockchain networks is directly tied to the **miner fee** you set. COCA Wallet gives you full control over this parameter, allowing you to balance urgency and cost.  

- **Higher Miner Fees**: Prioritize your transaction for faster confirmation. Ideal for time-sensitive transfers.  
- **Lower Miner Fees**: Save costs by opting for slower processing. Suitable for non-urgent transactions.  

#### How Miner Fees Work  
Imagine sending 1 BTC during peak network activity. If you set a miner fee of $10, the transaction might confirm in 10 minutes. Conversely, a $2 fee could extend confirmation to 1‚Äì2 hours. COCA Wallet provides real-time fee suggestions to help you make informed decisions.
