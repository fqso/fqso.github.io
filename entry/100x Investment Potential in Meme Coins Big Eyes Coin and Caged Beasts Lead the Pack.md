This strategic move positions BIG at the intersection of two booming markets â€“ meme coins and NFTs â€“ potentially multiplying investment opportunities.

With 75% of funds allocated to liquidity pools and 25% dedicated to marketing, the project combines technical security with aggressive community growth strategies.
