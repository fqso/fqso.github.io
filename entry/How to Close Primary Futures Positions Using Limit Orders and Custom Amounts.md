## Opening Futures Contract Positions  

Before closing positions, traders must first establish primary futures positions. Supported order types include:  

| Supported Order Types         | Advanced Features              |  
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
| Limit, Market, Advanced Limit (Post Only, FOK, IOC) | Take Profit (TP)/Stop Loss (SL), Trailing Stop, Activation |  
| Iceberg, TWAP                 | ‚ùå Not Supported               |

### Opening Steps:

2. Choose an order type (e.g., limit for price control).  
3. Execute the trade, triggering replication for followers.  

## Closing Futures Positions  

Closing positions involves two primary methods:  

### **Method 1: Position Management Interface**  

1. **Hedging Mode**:  
   - Navigate to the **Close** tab.  
   - Set orders with TP/SL or activation conditions.  

2. **One-Way Mode**:  
   - Place an opposing order to your open position.  

**Customization**: Adjust price and amount manually for partial closures.  

### **Method 2: Primary Trade Management Portal**  

Access **Trading > Primary Trades** or **Copy Trading > My Primary Trades** for detailed analytics. Key features include:  
- **Details View**: Manage individual orders with TP/SL adjustments.  
- **Overview Mode**: Close entire positions using market orders.  

### Example Workflow:  
1. Visit **Trading > Primary Trades**.  
2. Select a position to modify TP/SL levels.  
3. Use market orders for full closure or custom amounts for partial exits.  

## Setting Take Profit and Stop Loss  

Effective risk management requires strategic TP/SL placement. Here are four methods:  

### **1. During Order Placement**  
Enter TP/SL values in designated fields before confirming.  

### **2. Post-Order Activation**  
Input desired amounts in required fields to create TP/SL orders.  

### **3. From Active Positions**  
Edit TP/SL values directly in open position details.  

### **4. Primary Trade Dashboard**  
Use the TP/SL button on your profile page for centralized adjustments.  

## Spot Trading Considerations  

Spot traders face unique dynamics:  

| Order Type     | Supported for Primary Trading? | Generates Primary Trade? |  
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|  
| Limit/Market   | ‚úÖ Yes                         | ‚úÖ Yes                    |  
| Iceberg/TWAP   | ‚úÖ Yes                         | ‚ùå No                     |  

**Key Restrictions**:  
- Frozen assets cannot be used in Earn products or bots.  
- Broker trade management is unavailable for spot primary traders.  

## Copier Trade Mechanics  

When primary traders close positions:  
1. **Partial Closure**: Copiers replicate the percentage closed.  
2. **Full Closure**: Copiers exit entirely.  

This ensures alignment between traders and followers, maintaining proportional risk exposure.
