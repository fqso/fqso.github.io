## Understanding Tokenized Assets  

Tokenized assets represent real-world investments (e.g., bonds, real estate, or commodities) converted into digital tokens on a blockchain.

1. **Asset Digitization**: Physical or traditional assets are converted into blockchain-based tokens.  
2. **Smart Contracts**: Automate compliance, dividend distribution, and ownership transfers.  
3. **Decentralized Ledger**: Ensures transparency and immutability of transactions.  

### FAQ: What Makes Tokenized Assets Unique?  
**Q:** How do tokenized assets differ from cryptocurrencies?  
**A:** Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, tokenized assets are pegged to real-world value (e.g., fiat currency or commodities), offering stability and regulatory oversight.
