The cryptocurrency features a circulating supply of **7.03 million RAE** and a maximum supply capped at **34 million RAE**. This digital asset emerged as a solution to inefficiencies in content monetization models, aiming to redefine how creators and audiences interact in the digital economy.  

## What Is the Receive Access Ecosystem?  

Launched in **April 2019** by Martin Floreani (founder of FloSports) and the Rokfin team in Austin, Texas, the **Receive Access Ecosystem (RAE)** addresses a critical challenge in digital content distribution: the misalignment between content creators and their audiences. By leveraging blockchain technology, RAE seeks to disrupt traditional platforms that prioritize intermediaries over creators.  

### Key Features of RAE Token  
- **Decentralized Compensation Model**: Empowers creators with direct monetization tools.  
- **Network Surplus Distribution**: Allocates value generated through platform growth to participants.  
- **Autonomy for Creators**: Allows flexibility in content creation and audience engagement.  

## The Problem: Aggregation Theory and Content Monetization  

RAEâ€™s founding stems from **Ben Thompsonâ€™s Aggregation Theory**, which explains how dominant platforms like YouTube and Spotify aggregate users but capture disproportionate value. These platforms often:  
- **Prioritize advertiser interests** over creator autonomy.  
- **Limit monetization options** through rigid revenue-sharing models.  
- **Foster burnout** by forcing creators into algorithmic "rat races" for visibility.  

This imbalance results in diminished creative freedom and unstable income for content producers.  

## The RAE Solution: A Creator-Centric Protocol  

RAE Token introduces a decentralized protocol designed to realign incentives across the content ecosystem. Its core principles include:  

### 1. **Token-Based Value Distribution**
